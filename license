You now have a fully functional, polished, and distributable tool ready to be pushed to GitHub. The executable works on any modern Windows system without requiring administrator rights or external dependencies.

Feel free to customize the icon, add digital signing, or extend functionality (e.g., batch processing). Let me know if you need further enhancements such as automatic upload to ModsBase or Steam Workshop integration.
