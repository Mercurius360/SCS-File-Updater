# SCS File Updater

Professional tool for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator modders.

Quickly update the `mod_version` inside `.scs`, `.zip`, or `.rar` mod packages and get a correctly named output file.

## Features
- Drag & drop support
- Accepts precise versions (e.g., `1.50.2.15` or `5.16.*`)
- Always outputs a clean `.scs` file with version suffix
- Standalone Windows executable (no Python required)

## Usage
1. Run `SCS_File_Updater.exe`
2. Select your mod archive
3. Type the new version
4. Click **Update → New .scs**

The new file will appear in the same folder with `_vX_Y_Z` appended.
