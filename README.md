# scsfileupdater
Updates ATS/ETS2 scs files to what version you currently have, in a more easier way.

What does it do?
Once you drag your file into the program, you input the current version and hit Apply. It will do the rest, even creating an updated file, so you can enjoy the file without having to tweak it yourself.
